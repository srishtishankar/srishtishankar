ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Srishti Shankar.

ğŸ“š I'm a recent grad from UT Austin, specializing in Data Analytics and Applied Machine Learning.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems, particularly in areas like data analytics, data engineering, business intelligence, and natural language processing.

ğŸ”§ My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, AWS, Tableau, PySpark, and machine learning frameworks.

ğŸ’¼ Currently, I'm working as a Data Science intern at TxDOT and have previous 2+ years of work experience as a Data Analytics Engineer at ZS.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about data engineering, creating dashboards, or geeking out over The Office!

ğŸ’• Fun fact: Iâ€™m a matcha enthusiast and love curating Pinterest mood boards. When Iâ€™m not working, you might find me at a vegan sushi place.
